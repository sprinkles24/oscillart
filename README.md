# Shyla's Oscillart

Oscillart was my first time using Javascript, and one of my first HTML/CSS projects!
I followed [Hack Club's Oscillart Jam](https://jams.hackclub.com/batch/oscillart) and added my own features!

I made my version of Oscillart since I'm a beginner at web development and wanted to get more comfortable with creating and designing a website on my own, but still have some guidance when I got stuck. I also want to expand my web dev skills past just HTML and CSS, and Javascript seemed like the best next step!

## Features
You can play notes, change the color of the wave, change the volume (and therefore amplitude), and start and stop a recording of your wave that's saved as a .webm!

### Unique colors and styling

### Buttons to change the wave color

### Hackatime Embed
I tracked the hours I spent on this project with Hackatime, and embedded the time spent in the site!

### Buttons to Github Repository and Personal Website
I had never used buttons before this project, but since they were included in the tutorial to start playing the sound and start and stop the recording, I learnt how to create and style them and included my own!

## Skills Learnt
Since I've never worked with Javascript before, and am relatively new to HTML and CSS, I struggled with the JS aspects and centering divs in CSS. I learned to set the width, margin-left, and margin-right of a div to all add to 100%, which helps center objects. I also learned about buttons, horizontal rule (hr), and align-items, which will definitely help with future projects!
